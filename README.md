# Prototype 1 Design Journal

This first prototype, "Where's the Washroom?" explores a question that is central to both level design and real-world environment design; namely, that of wayfinding. In particular, this prototype seeks to explore how minimalistic landmarks can be and still allow players to navigate the environment effectively. Dropped into an almost exclusively blocked-out version of a theme park land, and equipped only with a stylized map, players are asked to locate a bathroom they can use.

Though this task might seem challenging given the abstractedness of the scenario, there several key landmarks that should allow players to orient themselves on the map with which they are provided. In particular, this prototype makes use of what is called a "weenie" in the theme park industry: a large landmark, visible over the tops of other structures, and typically located at the far end of a park or land to draw guests onward. Examples from real theme parks include the Disney castles, various "Mountains" in Disney parks, as well as the Graumann's Chinese Theatre replica and Tower of Terror at Disney's Hollywood Studios. These tower structures provide universally visible landmarks throughout the park, much like an enormous physical "North" arrow, and consequently can be used to navigate with the aid of a park map and other minimal features of the immediate surroundings. This prototype attempts to abstract the environment as much as possible in an attempt to see, in practice, if players can still navigate as long as they have a schematically correct map and a universally visible landmark.

Questions for playtesters:

1) How long did it take you to find a washroom you could use?

2) How many washrooms did you visit before finding one you could use?

3) At any point (including immediately on starting) did you feel absolutely lost? If so, please describe how you attempted to orient yourself. Were you successful in gaining your bearings?

4) Did you ever find yourself going in a complete circle unintentionally? What made you realize you were walking in a loop?

5) Do you feel there were any significant layout discrepancies between the bird's-eye representation on the map, and the ground-level experience of the actual space? If so, what specifically were they? Were any of these discrepancies confusing for orienting yourself?
